{"data": {"win_probability": 74.45, "strategy": "Given the 74.45% win probability from the Monte Carlo simulation, a strong bet is recommended to extract maximum value from your opponent.  The hand is a strong draw, but the high win probability suggests a bet sizing that reflects your confidence.  Consider a pot-sized or slightly larger bet to encourage a call from your opponent.  If your opponent raises, consider folding unless you have a strong reason to believe they are bluffing.  Adjust bet sizing based on your opponent's tendencies and betting patterns.", "key_concepts": ["Pot Odds:  Evaluate the pot odds offered by your opponent's bet to determine if the risk of calling is justified given your win probability.", "Implied Odds: Consider the potential future value of your hand if you hit your flush draw.  The high probability suggests implied odds are favorable.", "Hand Strength: Your hand is a strong draw, but not a made hand.  The Monte Carlo simulation provides a quantitative measure of your hand's strength.", "Opponent Modeling:  Understanding your opponent's playing style is crucial for determining their likely response to your bets and adjusting your strategy accordingly."], "mistakes_to_avoid": ["Slowplaying:  Given the high win probability, slowplaying is likely a mistake.  You should bet aggressively to maximize your winnings.", "Overbetting: While a strong bet is recommended, avoid overbetting, especially if your opponent is tight or passive.  A large bet might scare them away, reducing your profit.", "Calling too often:  If your opponent is betting aggressively, it might be better to fold, even with a high win probability, if the pot odds are unfavorable."]}, "created_at": 1747685723.8156745, "expires_at": 1747689323.8156745}
