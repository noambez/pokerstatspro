{"data": {"win_probability": 48.25, "strategy": "Given the 48.25% win probability, this hand is a coin flip pre-flop.  A cautious approach is recommended.  Consider limping or folding depending on opponent tendencies and table dynamics.  Only raise if you suspect a very weak opponent or if you are looking to steal the blinds.  Post-flop play will be highly dependent on the community cards.", "key_concepts": ["Pre-flop hand strength: Jack-high with a suited connector is a marginal hand pre-flop. It has potential but is vulnerable to many starting hands.", "Opponent tendencies:  Understanding your opponent's playing style (tight, loose, aggressive, passive) is crucial in deciding whether to play this hand.", "Pot odds and implied odds:  Consider the potential future bets and the value of the pot relative to your bet to determine if the risk is worth the reward.", "Position:  Acting later in the betting round (late position) gives you more information and allows for more strategic decisions."], "mistakes_to_avoid": ["Overplaying a weak hand:  This hand is easily dominated by many stronger starting hands.
