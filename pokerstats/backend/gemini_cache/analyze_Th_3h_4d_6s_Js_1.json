{"data": {"win_probability": 28.499999999999996, "strategy": "Given the low win probability (28.50%) and the weak starting hand (T3 offsuit), a cautious approach is recommended.  Consider folding pre-flop unless the pot odds are exceptionally favorable.  If you see the flop and it's relatively dry, folding is still the likely best option.  Only continue with a strong bet from your opponent indicating a very strong hand.  Bluffing is generally not advisable in this situation.", "key_concepts": ["Pot Odds: Carefully calculate the pot odds to determine if the risk of continuing is justified by the potential reward.  With a low win probability, the pot needs to be very attractive to call.", "Hand Strength:  Recognize that T3 offsuit is a very weak starting hand with limited potential.  The community cards haven't improved it significantly.", "Opponent's Range: Consider what range of hands your opponent might have.  A strong bet from them suggests they have a strong hand, making your weak hand even less likely to win.", "Implied Odds: While implied odds are important, they are less relevant in this scenario given the low win probability and the risk of further investment with a weak hand."], "mistakes_to_avoid": ["Chasing draws:  Avoid chasing draws aggressively with such a weak starting hand, especially if the pot odds don't support it.", "Overestimating your hand:  Don't overestimate the strength of your hand based on the community cards.  Your hand is still weak and unlikely to win.", "Bluffing too often:  Bluffing with this hand is risky given the low win probability and the likelihood of being called by a stronger hand."]}, "created_at": 1747695235.472928, "expires_at": 1747698835.472928}
